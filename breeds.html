            <p class="lead mx-4">The Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is
                characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a
                pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent
                competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as
                a guide dog.
                The breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth
                century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of
                Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and
                during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.</p>

            <p class="lead">The beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger
                foxhound. The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare known as beagling. Possessing a great
                sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog
                for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is
                intelligent and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.
                The modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the
                Talbot Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier.
                Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature and paintings and
                more recently in film, television, and comic books.</p>

            <p class="lead mx-4">The German Shepherd[a] or Alsatian is a German breed of working dog of medium to large
                size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from
                1899.
                It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types
                of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It is commonly
                kept as a companion dog, and according to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale had the
                second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.</p>

            <p class="lead">Husky is a general term for a dog used in the polar regions, primarily and specifically for
                work as sled dogs. It refers to a traditional northern type, notable for its cold-weather tolerance and
                overall hardiness. Modern racing huskies that maintain arctic breed traits (also known as Alaskan
                huskies) represent an ever-changing crossbreed of the fastest dogs.[3][4]

                Huskies have continued to be used in sled-dog racing, as well as expedition and trek style tour
                businesses, and as a means of essential transportation in rural communities.[5] Huskies are also kept as
                pets, and groups work to find new pet homes for retired racing and adventure-trekking dogs.</p>

            <p class="lead mx-4">The Labrador Retriever or simply Labrador is a British breed of retriever gun dog. It
                was developed in the United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a
                province of Canada), and was named after the Labrador region of that colony. It is among the most
                commonly kept dogs in several countries, particularly in the Western world.

                The Labrador is friendly, energetic, and playful. It was bred as a sporting and hunting dog but is
                widely kept as a companion dog. It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or
                therapy work.
                In the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott,[4]
                imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gun dogs. Another early
                advocate of these Newfoundland fishing dogs was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury, who bred them for their
                expertise in waterfowling.</p>

                the Pomerania region in north-west Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe. Classed as a toy dog
                breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from larger Spitz-type dogs, specifically
                the German Spitz. It has been determined by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale to be part of the
                German Spitz breed; and in many countries, they are known as the Zwergspitz.</p>

            <p class="lead mx-4">The Pug is a breed of dog originally from China, with physically distinctive features
                of a wrinkly, short-muzzled face and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a
                variety of colors, most often light brown (fawn) or black, and a compact, square body with well
                developed and thick muscles all over the body.

                Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe
                by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart. In the United Kingdom, in the
                nineteenth century, Queen Victoria developed a passion for pugs which she passed on to other members of
                the Royal Family.

                Pugs are known for being sociable and gentle companion dogs.[3] The American Kennel Club describes the
                breed's personality as "even-tempered and charming". Pugs remain popular into the twenty-first
                century, with some famous celebrity owners.</p>
